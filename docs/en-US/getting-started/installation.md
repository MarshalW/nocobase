## CLI

### 0. Before start

Please make sure you have Node.js 12.x or above installed. You can download and install the latest LTS version from the official website. It is recommended to use nvm (or nvm-windows for Win systems) to manage Node.js versions if you plan to work with Node.js for a long time.

```bash
$ node -v

v16.13.2
```

yarn package manager is recommend.

```bash
$ npm install --global yarn
$ yarn -v

1.22.10
```

Also, make sure you have configured and started the required database, which supports SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL.

### 1. Create a NocoBase project

```bash
# SQLite
yarn create nocobase-app my-nocobase-app -d sqlite
# MySQL
yarn create nocobase-app my-nocobase-app -d mysql \
   -e DB_HOST=localhost \
   -e DB_PORT=3356 \
   -e DB_DATABASE=nocobase \
   -e DB_USER=nocobase \
   -e DB_PASSWORD=nocobase
# PostgreSQL
yarn create nocobase-app my-nocobase-app -d postgres \
   -e DB_HOST=localhost \
   -e DB_PORT=5432 \
   -e DB_DATABASE=nocobase \
   -e DB_USER=nocobase \
   -e DB_PASSWORD=nocobase
```

### 2. switch to the project directory

```bash
cd my-nocobase-app
```

### 3. Install dependencies

üì¢ This next step may take more than ten minutes due to network environment, system configuration, and other factors.  

```bash
# For production deployments, you can install only the necessary dependencies to reduce the dependency size and download time
yarn install --production
# Or, install the full dependencies
yarn install
```

### 4. Install & Start NocoBase

```bash
# Start the application in a production environment. Recompile it if the source code has been modified (yarn build)
yarn start
# Start the application in the development environment. The code will be compiled in real time
yarn dev
```
